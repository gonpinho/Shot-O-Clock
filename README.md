At the 48-hour hackaton promoted by Academia de CÃ³digo, we developed a Web App with a Java back-end and MySQL persistence that communicated through a REST API so that the front-end could build dynamic pages according to the theme. <br><br>
The concept was simple, creating an application that takes the responsibility of the hosts who want to organize a theme party, offering a Spotify playlist, a set of cocktails and a set of fun facts to encourage socializing among the participants.
